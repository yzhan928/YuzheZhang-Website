        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>I am a second generation student athlete which my father and my uncle influenced me to pursue my dream in becoming a professional golfer. I started the interest of playing golf ever since I could remember. I would bring my toy golf club whenever my father was playing on the course. I started falling in love with the idea and ruling of the sport. I then started having ambition whenever I was playing with friends around seven years old. The path started when I was nine years old, when my father asked me if I wanted to pursue a career in playing golf. My family and I then immigrated to the United States due to the perfect conditions to train and fierce tournament environments. During my time in the United States, my family and I moved to various cities and states just so that we could find the best golf coach suited for me. Several places such as Riverside, Hacienda Heights, and Walnut in California or Windermere in Florida. 
<br>
       
        The road of being a student athlete is not as easy as one could assume. Countless hours of training, competition every week, and pursuing perfection with coaches was extremely exhausting for a student. However, it was nice of how my family provided me with all their support. Since both my father and my uncle were student athletes when they were in school, they prepped me with the shortcoming of being a student athlete compared to a regular student. I still wanted to pursue my dream because I thoroughly enjoy playing the sport I love and I feel like a different person whenever Iâ€™m on the golf course. Having a passion in a sport or career can not prevent any roadblock along the way. Junior tournaments were relatively easier when it came to competing with others, but it started getting a lot harder when I started high school. Therefore, I needed lots of practice compared to middle school. High school years were the toughest before college. Competition was harder because the field was significantly stronger, school work was harder because both the workload and the grading was harsh on the students.
<br>
        <br>

        My experience with high school was one of the rare ones, I had transferred to three different high schools due to various reasons. After spending my freshman year in Florida, everything was great. However, my family and I had to move back to California due to the travel difficulties from Florida and China. Therefore, I transferred to Walnut High School and was fortunate enough to join the varsity boys golf team. My experience in Walnut High School was one of the best times of my school life before college. My teammates were supportive and my coaches gave me more advice than he should have. Although it was really helpful to be a part of Walnut High Schoolâ€™s varsity golf team. My family and I hit another roadblock caused by the coronavirus pandemic. We had to move back to China during the toughest times during the pandemic because my family wanted to stay close to each other during the hard times. Therefore, I had to undergo another transfer back to an international school in my hometown. Competition was not as fierce and the practicing environment was not as good. However, I was still fortunate enough to join UC Riverside Menâ€™s Golf Team and play at NCAA Division I level.
